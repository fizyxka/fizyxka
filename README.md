<p align="center"> hello, call me Fiz, plz. </p>

i don't care about pronouns, so you can use any.

i draw and write (mainly based on countryhumans), you can see it on my tg channel. also i have AU on countryhumans. i've been in fandom countryhumans since 2018, though i left in 2020 and only returned at the end of 2023. my favorite ship is rusame.

in Pony Town you can find me mostly on Safe Russian #1 and 18+ Russian. you can interact with me by any means (except roleplay), but if you want me to answer you with 99% certainly, interact with me in whisper. and i'm very sorry, if i don't reply you, cuz i'm often afk and i mignt not notice your message.
